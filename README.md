# MTV230M-headers
Documentation and register/flag definitions for the Myson MTV230M microcontroller as used on the GBS8200 video scaler (in other words, doing what the manufacturer didn't bother)

## Contents
- **MTV230M_XFR.h**: defines locations for the eXternal Function Registers
- **MTV230M_XFR_bits.h**: defines offsets for particular bits in those registers
- **MTV230M_XFR_masks.h**: defines masks to prevent writing to read-only registers

- **Documentation**: Datasheet of the MCU and a spreadsheet with a register map used as a development aid. May contain an unnecessary macro, which I mistakenly added and have no idea how to strip.
